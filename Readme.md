# OS's for sensitive data handling

Very small list of Linux OS's I've used for sensitive data handling. 

**Trusted End Node Security**

This is a DOD MIL distribution. I use this distro to access sensitive intelligence community sites. This DOD site uses its own internal root ca. So you will get errors about the encrypted website being unsecure. Make sure to use the Encrypt DNS application before accessing sensitive material.

**Discrete Linux**

Use this distro with caution. It has not been updated since 2016. Its meant for airgapped network testing and accessing sensitive data. Its an interesting project but not really maintained. I do find it noteworthy for what it does.

# NSA privacy focuses disclosures

I won't be linking NSA's slide decks of PRISM but you can find it on your own. This is just an interesting website of alternatives to closed source software.

**Prism Break**
